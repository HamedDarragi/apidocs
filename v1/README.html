<h1>SkovRejser API v 1.0.0</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Below you will find a few notes and insights on how SkovRejser API works.</p>
<p>Remember: in the German TO universe <strong>assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups</strong>. Please do ask instead of assuming behaviour.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<h3>General authentication mechanism</h3>
<p>User authentication will be done using <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JWT</a>.</p>
<p>You will obtain a JWT from the <i>/tokens</i> endpoint. You can then send the token in the <i>Authorization</i> header on every request that requires the user to be logged in.</p>
<p>Please be aware that JWT are short lived and they will need to be refreshed periodically. You should check the token expiration date periodically and refresh it when required.</p>

<h2>API Usage in booking workflow</h2>

<h3>This is a mock API</h3>
<p>This is a mock API. Some endpoints are not mocked, others are mocked partially or return a static response. Please keep that in mind.</p>

<h3>Destination autocomplete</h3>
<p>Probably the first step is the destination autocomplete. you can use the <i>/destinations</i> endpoint for this. You will obtain 3 type of destinations from this search:
region, location and hotel. You should use the id of the chosen destination in the hotel search.</p>

<h3>Hotel search</h3>
<p>Get a list of hotels by using the <i>/offers/package</i> endpoint. Possible filter that can be applied will be supplied by the <i>/filters/packageOffers</i>, as they are faceted to the current search.</p>
<p>Depending on the destination type provided to the search, this endpoint can be used to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Obtain a list of the best package offer for each available hotel(when destination is of type region or location)</li>
    <li>Obtain a list of the best package offer for a given hotel, for different periods(when destination is of type hotel)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not all hotels have a rating structure</li>
    <li>Not all hotels have a thumbnail or a preview text</li>
</ul>

<h4>Filtering</h4>
<p>Use the <i>/filters/packageOffers</i> endpoint to determine which filters can be applied to a given search.</p>

<h3>Hotel Offers</h3>
<p>Once a user has selected a hotel, you can then obtain all the package offers associated to the hotel from the <i>/offers/packages/{hotelId}</i> endpoint.</p>
<p>It is recommended to make 2 searches, in parallel, with <i>transferIncluded=true</i> and <i>transferIncluded=false</i> and merge the obtained lists.</p>
<p>Each offer should be verified before displaying it to the user, as it might be cached.</p>
<p>If the user set filters on the package search, you should also use them on the offers search.</p>

<h3>Verify Offers</h3>
<p>Verifying an offer is done using the <i>/offers/{offerCode}</i> endpoint. Offer verification ensures that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>offer is still available</li>
    <li>determines the correct price</li>
    <li>determines the correct flight schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>A verify response might return different price and flight schedule. A verify response will not return any data about the transfer, room type, location and facility.
    You should use the ones provided in the initial offer.</p>
<p>A verify response will also contain the payment types allowed for the given offer.</p>

<h3>Book Offers</h3>
<p><strong>Bookings are binding. Please make extra sure during dev not to accidentally book one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before submitting the booking, verify the offer once more, as it is possible for the price or flight schedule to change. In this case, advise the user of the change
and require them to actively confirm the changes(with f.eks. a checkbox). It is also possible for an offer availability to expire in the time-frame spent filling out the booking form.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Offers with verified status <i>RQ</i> have to be presented to the user with a disclaimer.</strong></p>
<p>If the user is logged in, you should autocomplete the customer section of the form with the user data.</p>
<p>Only allow the user to use payment types provided in the offer type.</p>

<h4>User creation</h4>
<p>If the user is not logged in, you should create one or ask the user to log in before submitting a booking request.</p>
<p>If the user is logged in, please consider updating the user data with the one in the customer section.</p>

<h4>Mocking the response of a booking or a verify</h4>
<p>On dev and staging environments it will be possible to mock the response obtained from a booking or verify request. This can be done by adding the
<i>X-Mock-Response</i> header to the request, with one of the response scenarios available in the enums. <br>
If the header is set, the response will be delayed by a random number of seconds.
</p>

<h3>Updating a user password</h3>
<p>You can update the user password by sending a PATCH request to <i>/user</i>. The new password needs to be in plain text.
    If the authorization token used does not contained a <i>password_modifier</i> claim(was not obtained using a password reset token),
    the additional parameter <i>identityChallenge</i> will be required in order to prove user's identity.
</p>

<h3>Password Reset</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Making a post request to <i>/tokens/passwordReset</i>. This will send an email to the user with a URL containing a token.</li>
    <li><i>(Optionally)</i> Use the <i>/tokens/passwordReset/{token}</i> to validate that the token is valid and has not expired.</li>
    <li>Get a JWT from <i>/tokens</i>, using the reset password token from the URL.</li>
    <li>Use the said JWT to update the user password.</li>
    <li>Discard of the JWT obtained with the password reset token.</li>
</ol>
